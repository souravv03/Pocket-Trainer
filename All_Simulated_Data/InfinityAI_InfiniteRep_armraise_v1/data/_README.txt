InfiniteRep: The perfect vision dataset for fitness and PT applications

Brought to you by Infinity AI. Visit us at https://toinfinity.ai/


================ OVERVIEW ================

InfiniteRep makes it easier for engineers to build vision-based products in remote fitness and PT.

The dataset contains videos of diverse avatars doing multiple reps of common exercises. It includes massive variation in the environment, lighting conditions, avatar demographics, and movement trajectories. From cadence to kinematic trajectory, each rep is done slightly differently (just like real humans).

InfiniteRep videos are accompanied by a rich set of pixel-perfect labels and annotations, including rep counts, occlusion quantification, and 2D/3D supervision.


============= GETTING STARTED =============

Documentation and starter code can be found at our project page: https://github.com/toinfinityai/InfiniteRep


============ WANT MORE DATA? =============

Do you want synthetic data that's different than InfiniteRep? Different movements, labels, demographics, or anything else? We specialize in generating custom synthetic datasets. Drop us a line at info@toinfinity.ai.  


================= CONTACT =================

InfiniteRep is brought to you by Infinity AI. We're a small team of dedicated engineers who built this dataset hoping it would be useful to people like you! We're excited to hear from you (info@toinfinity.ai).
